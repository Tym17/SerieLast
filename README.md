#Serielast

This is an attempt to make a serie tracker to help keep track of the last episode you seen and when your favorite serie comes back on screen.

This is supposed to work with a basic Apache and PHP installation (You need the rewrite module activated) and sqlite3. so you should just have to drag and drop it on a shared webhosting and it should work instantly.
